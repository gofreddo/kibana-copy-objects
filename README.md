# kibana-copy-objects

Injects a copy button into /_plugin/kibana/app/kibana#/management/kibana/objects

You need to get ./inject/index.js loaded into the kibana page.  You can use something like Tampermonkey (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) 

or a proxy such as AWS ElasticSearch Kibana Proxy (https://github.com/santthosh/aws-es-kibana) in compbination with harmon (https://github.com/No9/harmon)

Sorry it's rough but it's late.  I plan to add more examples and clean up the code later.  Pull requests would be helpful.  I have tested it and it's working even if it's not beautiful.
